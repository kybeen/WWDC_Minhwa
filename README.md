This app introduces traditional Korean folk paintings called "Minhwa" using AI technology.

Minhwa is the most Korean-style painting that reflects the thoughts of the people during the late Joseon dynasty. Since it was mostly painted by the common people who were less influenced by foreign cultures, it has a free-spirited and unconventional feel. Compared to the paintings of nobles who learned how to paint, it may not be refined, but it is a simple and pure painting that very well reflects the artist's thoughts.

I wanted to convey the purity of the Joseon people to the busy modern day audience through Minhwa. I used a Style Transfer model generated by Create ML to reproduce the rustic yet distinctive painting style of Minhwa on the user's desired image.

Users can easily and enjoyably utilize the Style Transfer technology after hearing a brief explanation about Minhwa and Style Transfer. Through this technology, users can create "My Minhwa," which applies the painting style of a specific Minhwa.

The process of creating "My Minhwa" is as follows:

1. Choose one of the three provided styles of Minhwa in the app.
2. Import the desired image from the photo library or camera using ImagePicker.
3. When the user drags the imported image into Minhwa, the DragGesture() recognizes the user's swipe and performs style transfer by calling the style transfer model.
4. When the style transfer is performed, a modal window appears, and "My Minhwa" with the painting style of Minhwa is displayed.
5. To give the effect of admiring a work of art in a museum, RadialGradient() provides a lighting effect. Users can adjust the lighting effect using Slider().
6. Users can save "My Minhwa" in the photo library to keep it as a memento. UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum() is used for saving the photo. The image received from the Style Transfer model is 512x512 in size, so it goes through a process of applying the aspect ratio of the original image before being saved.
